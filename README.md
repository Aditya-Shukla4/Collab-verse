## 🛠 Tech Stack

Collab-verse is a robust, full-stack application built primarily with JavaScript technologies, utilizing a modular, microservice-style architecture.

-  * **Frontend (Client):** **React/Next.js** (Inferred) for a modern, scalable, and responsive user interface.
-  * **Backend (Server):** **Node.js / Express.js** for a fast, non-blocking API layer.
-  * **Database:** **MongoDB** (Inferred) for flexible data storage, ideal for rapidly evolving user profile data and chat history.
-  * **Real-time Communication:** **Socket.io** (Inferred) for the real-time chat functionality.
-  * **Containerization:** **Docker** (Confirmed via `Dockerfile` in repository) for consistent deployment of the `compiler-service`.
-  * **Core Languages:** JavaScript, CSS.

## 🌟 Key Features

1.  **Skill-Based Matching:** An intuitive interface allows users to discover potential collaborators by filtering based on programming languages, project experience, and specific technical skills.
2.  **GitHub Profile Verification:** User authenticity and expertise are established by linking and verifying profiles directly with GitHub.
3.  **Real-Time Chat:** Integrated, persistent messaging rooms for direct communication and planning between matched developers.
4.  **Integrated Code Compiler:** A dedicated `compiler-service` allows developers to test code snippets and collaborate on algorithmic solutions in real-time within the platform.
5.  **Project/Hackathon Listings:** Users can create and browse listings for open projects or hackathon teams seeking specific roles and expertise.

### Local Installation Steps (General)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Shukla4/Collab-verse.git
    cd Collab-verse
    ```
2.  **Set up the Backend (server):**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    # Set environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URL, API keys)
    npm start # Or run your setup script
    cd ..
    ```
3.  **Set up the Frontend (client):**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    # Set environment variables (e.g., API endpoint URL)
    npm start
    cd ..
    ```
4.  **Run the Compiler Service (compiler-service):**
    ```bash
    cd compiler-service
    # Use Docker to build and run the service
    docker build -t collab-compiler .
    docker run -p [PORT]:[PORT] collab-compiler
    cd ..
    ```
